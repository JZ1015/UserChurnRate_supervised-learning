# UserChurnRate_supervised-learning
This is a project to build supervised ML classification models to predict users' churn rate

There are seven sections in the project:
 
 ### 1.Data loading, observation(distribution, correlation, stripping)
 
 ### 2.Identify classification/regression problem, consider possible models
 
 ### 3.Feature Engineering, One-hot-encode (Linearty), drop (unrelated, univariance, low variance), split out ground truth
 
 ### 4.Model Selection, CV
 
 ### 5.Hyperparameter tuning, GridSearchCV
 
 ### 6.Model Evaluation, Confusion Matrix, ROC, AUC, MSE
 
 ### 7.Feature Selection, Coefficient, optimal number of features, RF feature importance
 
 Probablity option for classifiers

 loop through 3,4,5,6,7 for better model and better solution
